2026 match outcomes, tournament progression, champion probabilities, and
Golden Ball / best player candidates.

## Upstream repository

This workspace is now being maintained alongside the GitHub repository below:

- https://github.com/fzn011/WorldCupPredictionModel.git

When the upstream repo changes, I’ll treat it as the reference source for
future updates in this project.

## Project Description

This project combines historical international football data, FIFA rankings,
Elo ratings, and recent team form to build predictive models. A Monte Carlo
tournament simulator then projects how the World Cup 2026 might unfold across
the group stage and knockout rounds.

## Main Objective

Build a clean, transparent, portfolio-quality ML pipeline that can:

- Predict the result of any international football match.
- Estimate the most likely scoreline.
- Simulate the full World Cup 2026 thousands of times.
- Estimate per-team champion probabilities.
- Predict Golden Ball / best player candidates.
- Explain its predictions using feature importance and SHAP values.

## Planned Features

- Match result probabilities (win / draw / loss).
- Expected goals and most likely scoreline.
- Round-by-round team progression probabilities.
- Champion probability rankings.
- Best player / Golden Ball candidate ranking.
- Model evaluation and explainability dashboard.

## Machine Learning Approach

- Baseline: Logistic Regression / Random Forest on engineered match features.
- Advanced: Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) with calibrated probabilities.
- Score model: Poisson / bivariate Poisson for expected goals.
- Simulation: Monte Carlo with 10,000+ tournament runs.
- Explainability: Feature importance and SHAP values.

## Dataset Plan

Planned data sources (to be integrated in later steps):

- International match results (historical).
- FIFA world rankings.
- Elo ratings for national teams.
- Player-level statistics for the Golden Ball model.
- World Cup 2026 group draw and schedule.

> Step 1 ships with a small synthetic sample dataset only.

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate it
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

## Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Run the Tests

```bash
python -m pytest -q
```

## Step 6: Model Improvement Part 1

Step 6 improves the baseline model layer for probability-focused forecasting.

- **XGBoost** and **LightGBM** are optional and are skipped gracefully when unavailable.
- **HistGradientBoostingClassifier** is always trained as the safe fallback.
- **Probability calibration** is applied (sigmoid) to improve probability reliability.
- **Temporal backtesting** is run across multiple chronological windows.
- **Baseline vs improved comparison reports** are saved under `reports/`.
- The best improved model is saved under `models/improved/`.

### Step 6 commands

```bash
python scripts/train_improved_models.py
python scripts/inspect_improved_model_results.py
python main.py
python -m pytest -q
